REDUX:
    > redux is a state management library
    > it allows you to have global state
    > this state can accessible in any components of the tree
    > it is made by multiple slices (mini stores for understanding)

    STORE:
        > store is state which can be accessible in any components
        > you can define anything or every need of you component in store
    
    ACTIONS:
        > action is tell redux that what it should do to the state
    
    REDUCERS:
        > it responsible for taking an action, and depending upon a type of action
        > it make update in redux store
        > it never directly make an update to the redux store, it copy the state, update it and than change whole state, it overwrite the previous state

METHODS:
    1.) configureStore()
        > creates a Redux store, and also automatically configure the Redux DevTools extension so that you can inspect the store while developing.

    2.) Provider
        > it allow us to communicate with store
        > Once the store is created, we can make it available to our React components by putting a React-Redux <Provider>
        > Import the Redux store we just created, put a <Provider> around your <App>, and pass the store as a prop:
            <Provider store={store}>
                <App />
            </Provider />

    3.) createSlice:
        > this create everything we need, anything related to our slice (slice file)
        > actions, reducers, state all is created slice file

    4.) useSelector:
        > A hook to access the redux store's state. 
        > This hook takes a selector function as an argument. 
        > The selector is called with the store state

    5.) useDispatch:
        > A hook to access the redux dispatch function.


    createAsyncThunk()
        > this method is for asynchronous function,
        > while use it you have to add extraReducer in slice
