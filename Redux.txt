REDUX:
    > redux is a state management library
    > it allows you to have global state
    > this state can accessible in any components of the tree
    > it is made by multiple slices (mini stores for understanding)

    STORE:
        > store is state which can be accessible in any components
        > you can define anything or every need of you component in store
    
    ACTIONS:
        > action is tell redux that what it should do to the state
    
    REDUCERS:
        > it responsible for taking an action, and depending upon a type of action
        > it make update in redux store
        > it never directly make an update to the redux store, it copy the state, update it and than change whole state, it overwrite the previous state
